# SkyblockWorldEdit
My first plugin so please excuse any gross code, I'm only learning.
I was unable to find a way to undo playerworldedits so I just forced the player to do //undo, gross I know but I was trying to figure this out for like 3 days and just gave up in the end.
I am not sure how to use AsyncWorldEdit to do the //undo of a playerworldedit.
